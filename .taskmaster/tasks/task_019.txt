# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement User Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up user authentication with Supabase Auth for secure access to the dashboard and personalized experiences.
# Details:
Integrate Supabase Auth for user authentication. Create sign-up, sign-in, and password reset flows. Implement social authentication options if needed. Set up protected routes in Next.js using middleware. Create a user profile page for account management. Implement session management with refresh tokens. Store user preferences and settings in Supabase. Create authentication hooks for React components. Implement role-based access control for different user types (admin, regular user). Use Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies to secure data access.

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication flows including sign-up, sign-in, and password reset. Verify protected routes redirect unauthenticated users. Test session persistence and token refresh. Validate role-based access controls work correctly.
