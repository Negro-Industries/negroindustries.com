# Task ID: 23
# Title: Integrate Vercel AI SDK for Conversational AI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the Vercel AI SDK to power multi-turn AI conversations with personality-driven agents.
# Details:
Install and configure Vercel AI SDK (latest version). Set up OpenAI API integration with appropriate models (GPT-4 or equivalent). Create AI agent personalities and system prompts for each of the six defined agents. Implement conversation memory and context management. Create function calling capabilities for tool execution. Implement streaming responses for real-time interaction. Set up conversation logging and analytics. Create fallback mechanisms for handling AI limitations. Implement prompt engineering techniques for consistent agent personalities. Create a prompt management system for easy updates.

# Test Strategy:
Test multi-turn conversations for coherence and context retention. Verify each agent maintains its unique personality. Test function calling with various tools. Validate streaming response performance. Test error handling with API failures.
