# Task ID: 25
# Title: Develop OpenAI Function Calling for Tool Execution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23, 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement OpenAI function calling to allow AI agents to execute tools and perform actions based on user conversations.
# Details:
Define function schemas for various tools (repository creation, deployment, social posting, etc.). Implement function handlers for each tool. Create a function registry system to manage available tools. Implement permission checking for function execution. Create a function execution logging system. Implement rate limiting for API-intensive functions. Create mock functions for testing and development. Implement error handling and retry mechanisms. Create a function execution queue for asynchronous operations. Implement function result caching where appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
Test function calling with various inputs. Verify permission checking works correctly. Test rate limiting functionality. Validate error handling and retry mechanisms. Test asynchronous function execution.
