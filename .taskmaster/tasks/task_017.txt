# Title: Implement Geist Mono Typography and ASCII-inspired Design System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a design system with Geist Mono font and ASCII-inspired UI components for the minimal, high-end aesthetic.
# Details:
Install Geist Mono font via npm using `@vercel/typography` or directly from the Vercel font repository. Create a global CSS file to define typography scales and font weights. Develop reusable ASCII-inspired UI components including buttons, cards, dividers, and terminal windows using CSS and potentially SVG for complex ASCII art. Implement a monochrome color palette with black, white, and grayscale values. Create a theme provider using React Context API to manage the design system. Ensure all components are responsive using CSS Grid and Flexbox. Document the design system with Storybook or a custom documentation page.

# Test Strategy:
Test the design system across different viewport sizes to ensure responsiveness. Verify font loading performance. Create visual regression tests for UI components. Validate accessibility compliance using axe or similar tools.
