# Description: Configure Supabase for database, real-time communication, and state management to support the platform's backend needs.
# Details:
Create a Supabase project and configure database tables for users, projects, agent activities, and conversations. Set up Supabase Realtime channels for live updates. Create database schemas with proper relationships and constraints. Implement Row Level Security policies for data protection. Set up Supabase Edge Functions for serverless backend logic. Configure Supabase Storage for file uploads if needed. Create database indexes for performance optimization. Set up database triggers for event-driven workflows. Implement database migrations for version control of schema changes. Create TypeScript types for database entities using Supabase's generated types.

# Test Strategy:
Test database CRUD operations for all entities. Verify real-time subscriptions work correctly. Test Row Level Security policies with different user roles. Validate performance with sample data load.
