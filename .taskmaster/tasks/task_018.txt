# Title: Develop Terminal-Style Dashboard Layout
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a TMUX-inspired terminal layout for the dashboard with multiple panes for displaying agent activities.
# Details:
Design a responsive grid layout that mimics terminal multiplexers like TMUX. Implement resizable and collapsible panes using CSS Grid and JavaScript for interactivity. Create a terminal window component with features like title bar, minimize/maximize buttons, and scrollable content area. Use monospace fonts and terminal-like styling (cursor, command prompts, etc.). Implement keyboard shortcuts for pane navigation. Create a layout persistence system using localStorage or server-side storage. Ensure the layout is responsive and degrades gracefully on mobile devices by stacking panes vertically.

# Test Strategy:
Test pane resizing, collapsing, and expanding functionality. Verify keyboard shortcuts work as expected. Test layout persistence across page reloads. Validate responsive behavior across different device sizes.
